## ▶ Challenge 7 — Callbacks
Run:
node callback-read.js

Output:
- Reads data.txt asynchronously
- Shows non-blocking behavior
- Prints "Read operation completed" after delay

---

## ▶ Challenge 8 — Promises
Run:
node promise-file-copy.js

Output:
- Reads input.txt
- Writes to output.txt
- Logs success message

---

## ▶ Challenge 9 — Async/Await
Run:
node async-await-copy.js

Output:
- Same copy operation
- Uses async/await
- Adds artificial delay
